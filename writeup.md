## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[The most common sentiment observed in the sample is *negative*]

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[I think the labels are reliable up to a point. When dealing with sentiments that clearly state positive reviews or negative reviews it is reliable, but if a review is ambigious then the labels might be a little bias or over-generalizing. Some risks that can be introduced is introducing biases if the reviews are not handled accurately or misleading data about a product.]

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[Based on the reviews and feedback of this product, I would recommend they focus on improving customer satisfaction by fixing some major issues with the product. Some of these issues such as the taste of the product since the negative reviews were the most frequent sentiment and customers mentioned their dissatisfaction with the taste a number of times. I would also suggest maybe going back to older packaging since this was also an issue that seemed to come up a lot with customers. Due to the company selling a natural / healthy product, maybe moving away from plastic might be an option to look into.]
